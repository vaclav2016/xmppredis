# XMPP to REDIS bridge

Here is implementation XMPP/REDIS bridge in C. xmppredis will receive/send messages between Jabber and REDIS-queue's (or channel?).

NOTE: For me, this project looks like in a fine state. BUT: This project is not tested for production.

What use case for this project?

* For hardware/languages without support asynchronios execution (like multithreading/pthreads or something like a Java JMS) - PHP language, Arduino hardware etc.
* For hardware/languages, which havn't rich hardware/libraries - Arduino, STM32 etc. For example: libopenssl may be is too big for Arduino, but notification exchange is strong require crypto-protection.
* Building bridges between social platforms (email etc)

In this cases, You just a place message to REDIS queue.

Message format is simple text:

    jid:somebody@jabberserver.org
    message text

For inbound queue - it will be sender jid, for outbound queue - it will be receiver jid.

## How it works ? Example in PHP

It works just via REDIS-commands PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE:
http://redis.io/commands/publish

This example PHP-script is try to send message to jid somebody@a35a17e05e4z6vxdl.onion:

    <?php

    $jid = "somebody@a35a17e05e4z6vxdl.onion";
    $msg = "Hello, world!";
    $outQueue = "out_testbot";

    $redis = new Redis();
    $redis->pconnect( "127.0.0.1", 6379 );
    $redis->publish( $outQueue, "jid:" . $jid . "\n" . $msg );

    echo "Done!";

    ?>

How act this example?

1. PHP push message to queue 'out_testbot' in REDIS
2. xmppredis, as 'out_testbot' queue subscriber, pickup message from queue
3. xmppredis parse and send message to somebody@a35a17e05e4z6vxdl.onion

So, if You want receive jabber-messages via xmppredis - You must execute 'SUBSCRIBE in_testbot' in your application.


## Xmppredis run and configuration

You can run it with:

    $ xmppredis testbot xmppredis.conf

Where testbot - is a section into .conf file with bot profile.
Lets check xmppredis.conf:

    [localhostRedis]

    host=127.0.0.1
    port=6379

    [testbot]

    jid=testbot@not-jabber.org
    password=secret

    redis=localhostRedis

    inbound=in_testbot
    outbound=out_testbot

So, when we run 

    $ xmppredis testbot xmppredis.conf

we mean section [testbot] with bot configuration.

String 'redis=localhostRedis' has the same reference - it is mean to take REDIS host/port from section [localhostRedis].

So, multiple bot can have reference to the same REDIS server.

## TODO

I have ideas to growthup this tool, but I havn't job. So, if You want help this project, You can spend few satoshi (or may be bitcoins):

* To start Skype bridge, bitcoin-wallet is: 1QAfNs5Utygt2XQoV3YCykzHs63S3AfEJ3
* To start Facebook bridge, bitcoin-wallet is: 1DQWKuG6kUpkzkYX52k6VccbPoP3XSYxYC
